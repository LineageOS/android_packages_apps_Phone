      "message": "Please note that I resolved the interdependency of \u0027block private\u0027 and \u0027block unknown\u0027 on purpose: While it makes sense to make their UI depend on each other (why would one want to block numbers not in the contact list, but at the same time allow private numbers?), there is no reason to enforce that condition in the backend as well. By making such policy decisions UI-only, it\u0027s easier to revise things later on if needed.",

      "message": "Danny, this is true, but in our tests this structure (it was exactly my original one) introduced one bug, as follows (pn\u003dprivate numbers blacklisting, un\u003dunknown number blacklisting): if one enables pn, then un, then disables pn the desired behavior is that all calls pass (no other blacklist setting being activated, of course); instead, the un flag rules, and when a private number reaches my phone (note that pn is NOT enabled), the CallerInfo block is processed, contactExists returns false (obviously, being the number the constant 0000), and a MATCH_UNKNOWN is fired, displaying the wrong message \"Unknown number: 0000\".\nThis happens on my cm-10 (I\u0027ve ported the changes to it, since I use a cm-10 on my i9100).\nPlease check this out!!!",
