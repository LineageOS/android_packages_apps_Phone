      "message": "Value \u003d\u003d null is a condition that can never happen. You need to either\n- throw out the check completely\n- check conf for validity (\u003e\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 \u003c values.length) before accessing the array\n\nWhich of the two is the right one depends on how certain you are about the validity of conf. I would probably do the latter:\n\nif (conf \u003c 0 || conf \u003e\u003d values.length) {\n    return null;\n}\nreturn values[conf];\n\nMaybe the length check should be done in getVoiceQualityValue to make sure the summary code works as well without possibly throwing ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.",
