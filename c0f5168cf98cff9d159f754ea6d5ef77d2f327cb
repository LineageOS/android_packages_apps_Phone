      "message": "I\u0027d suggest splitting this block. It should not handle the notification stuff, but only the actual blacklist removal. The notification stuff and the toast (and the remove broadcast - deleting from the activity would also be fine with me though) IMHO should go into a separate activity with transparent theme that\u0027s called from the notification action. That way, the notification area is automatically closed as well.",

      "message": "The behaviour of the insert and remove broadcasts is asymmetric:\n- insert just inserts\n- remove removes, but also kills notification, messes with system dialogs and shows a toast\n\nIMHO, this cries \u0027bad design\u0027 ;) Hence I suggest to split out the notification specific functionality to a separate (transparent) activity which kills the notification, shows the toast, sends the remove broadcast and finishes itself afterwards. When making the content intent an activity instead of a broadcast, one also doesn\u0027t need to mess around with collapsing the notification area, because that is handled by the system.",

      "message": "Danny,  I\u0027m not actually sure we should have this functionality - hence why I removed it in ps18.\n\nEven though this functions exactly like code further down is this file (voicemail notification dismiss if I recall) What bothered me about it is feature is that the behaviour of the notification is inconsistent with other notifications\n\nI wanted it to give the user feedback that the number has been removed but cannot do that via a Toast while the shade is down, but collapsing the shade automatically will make managing of other notifications inconvenient and leads to an inconsistent UX.  So I asked myself if the toast is really that important?  Other notifications (e.g. Mark read on Mms) does not show confitmations so why should this one?\n\nWe have to programmatically dismiss the notification itself but the rest I decided to drop since I\u0027m not happy with the resulting UX.\n\nWhat I am wondering is if we should not mirror what the new Gmail notification does when you use the delete action - updates the notification itself and then it auto dismisses in 2 or 3 seconds.\n\n??",
