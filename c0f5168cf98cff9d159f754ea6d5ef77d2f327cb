      "message": "I\u0027d suggest splitting this block. It should not handle the notification stuff, but only the actual blacklist removal. The notification stuff and the toast (and the remove broadcast - deleting from the activity would also be fine with me though) IMHO should go into a separate activity with transparent theme that\u0027s called from the notification action. That way, the notification area is automatically closed as well.",
