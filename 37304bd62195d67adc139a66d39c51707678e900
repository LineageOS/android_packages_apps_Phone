      "message": "There seems to be at least one call path (at CallNotifier.java:1958) that directly uses this API, which won\u0027t honor the rejected_as_missed option. I am not familiar enough with that code so I handled the option check in this function.\n\nI wonder if you would have to do the same.",

      "message": "Indeed, I\u0027ve also noticed it, but to me the code is unfamiliar as well. In addition, it seemed to deal with CDMA calls, and since I don\u0027t have any reliable way to test, I prefered to not fiddle with it.\n\nHowever, now that I look at it again, it seems reasonable to implement the check in CallNotifier.java. This way, it will also handle correctly the missed call notification in onCdmaCallWaitingReject(), just like in onDisconnect() with the proposed patch.\n\nI\u0027ll prepare a new patch set and upload it.",
